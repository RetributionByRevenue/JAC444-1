Workshop 3 Reflection 

I learned how to utilize interface and abstract classes in this workshop and have become more familiar to polymorphism and
inheritance. This workshop also aided in my understanding of superclasses and subclasses and the concepts that belong to it,
such as the use of the keyword super and perfecting my uses in the getter and setter methods. Finally, it is reintroducing
the exception handling concepts to me.

The one thing that I find that was somewhat difficult in this workshop was trying to do the exception handling since I forgot
everything I knew about it from last semester. As such, I had to watch some youtube tutorials before I could attempt it. 

As for instructions on running the code, it is fairly simple as it doesn't require the user to input anything. Just run the 
code and all the data will be presented.
