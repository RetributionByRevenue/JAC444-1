Reflection

Task 1

I learned how to create my first GUI application. Althought it wasn't the prettiest thing, the elements were all there. This 
includes having the proper texts, having a textfield for the user to type in, a choicebox for the user to select their desired
option, and buttons. The hardest thing about this task was that I was very unfamiliar with this as I've never design and built 
an application before. Therefore, I had to watch many youtube tutorials, even for creating simple things such as textfields,
choicebox, etc. 

task 2

I learned how to use RandomAccessFiles. The challenging part of this was figuring out how to tie everything together. What I mean
is how to extract the data the user inputted and copy it into the textfile. This was the part of the workshop I spent the most time
on. 

To run the code, simply press run and an application will be created. Simply enter the data into the textfield and choose the
desired option in the ChoiceBox. Click add and the data will be stored. Simply add more as desired the data will be added. To
update the file, simply press the next, previous, first, last buttons until the data you want to change appears. When you changed
the data you wanted, simply press update.
