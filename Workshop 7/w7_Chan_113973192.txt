Task 1 Reflection

For this task, I learned about List and collection interfaces. This also helped reinforced my knowledge of Java I/O and some 
of the features related with the List class, ex: reverse, retainAll, removeAll, etc. The hardest part was devising a way
to find common elements from 2 lists, which I was able to solve thanks to some research. To run this task, simply hit the 
run button and follow the instruction prompts. It will ask if you want to run the program or not. Answer, and then when 
prompted, enter the file name you want. Then it will display the names in many ways (common names, list with common names 
removed, etc)

Task 2 Reflection

The learning from this task is the same for my task 1. To run, simply follow the prompts. It will ask which country's capital 
city you want to see. After you entered your choice, it will show the city.
