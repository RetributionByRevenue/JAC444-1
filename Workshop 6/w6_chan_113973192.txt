task1 reflection

For this task, I've reinforced my understanding with JavaFX and was able to create a new GUI. Also, I'm more confident using
event handling and was able to apply my knowledge of using FileReader with combination of Scanner to read the file and saving
the data within an array. The one thing that I had to research for was how to switch to a completely new scene when a button
is pressed. 

To run this program, simply press the run button and a Java application will appear. When it does, simply enter the correct
info within the textfield and press enter. This will take you to a new Scene and display the result in a textfield. To search
for another name, press yes. To exit, press no. 

Task2 reflection

For this task, I've been exposed to lambda expressions and was only somewhat able to grasp its concept. It required a fair amount
of self learning on my part and even so, I am not fairly confident using it. As such, I found task 2 to be considerably harder.
Therefore, I know I wasn't able to accomplish everything that is required for this task. To run this program, press run and 
enter the values as prompted. Then press enter and the result will show itself.
