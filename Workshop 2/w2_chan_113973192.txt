Reflection

For this workshop, I've reinforced my knowledge and ability to use arrays. For this workshop, I've also learned to utilize
some of java's built in function, such as import java.text.DecimalFormat. This allows me to use the new DecimalFormat().format()
to round numbers. I've also utilized the constructors in java. Although I'm still not that confident in my programming, I do
feel more comfortable with java than last week. 

As to how to run the code, just hit the run button and the console will display command prompts. The first prompt will show
what the user would like to do and will display 3 options. The first option is compute personal income tax. Second option is
to show a tax table. Third option will exit the program. For the first option, it will display 4 statuses and the user will
have to choose which status best represents them. Once that is chosen, they have to enter their income so that the correct 
tax rate will be used to calculate how much tax they have to pay. If the user chose option 2 in the first menu, then they will
be prompted to enter a range. Once they pressed enter, it will display a table of each tax category and basically shows how much 
taxes will be owed within the range they entered. The table will show tax rates from 2001 and 2009. Lastly, should the user
enter 3, then the program will end.
