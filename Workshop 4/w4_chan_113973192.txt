Workshop 4 reflection

The thing I learned from this workshop is learning how to read a file and finding ways to copy its content into an array. 
This workshop helped me to learn more and code utilizing IO features. This workshop also challenged me in doing external
researches, such as utilizing the Random class methods to help me choose a random word for task 1. Doing this workshop also
helped me polish my java coding skills and encouraging me to do some research and self teaching. 

task 1

The most challenging part of this task is coming up with the logic for the hangman game. Coming up with how to match the character
with the game word and releaving the hidden word was the most challenging part. 

To run this program, simply press the run button and follow the command prompts. It will prompt you to enter a guess. Enter a single
character and then press enter. Repeat this process whenever prompted until the word is revealed. 

task 2

The hardest part of this task was coming up with the for loop that will match the lower and upper case alphabets with the 
file content. I finally figured out this problem by creating a separate array for lower and upper case of alphabets and 
doing a nested loop so each case sensitive alphabet array can scan through each alphabet in each word string. 

To run this program, simply enter the name of the file. The filename I created for this program is task2.txt. Enter this name
when prompted and then it will display all the number of occurence for each alphabet.
