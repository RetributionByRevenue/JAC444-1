Reflection
For this task, the most challenging part of this was trying to establish connection between the clients with server. I had to 
watch many youtube tutorials to get started. In the end, I've learned how to at least create a connection with server and 
start communication between the client and server. 

To run this, simply hit the run button to create the windows and type in the message you want to display. I've made these in
separate files so you will have to go to the server directory and run it and do it again for the client side.
